    text: 'Earlier this year we introduced the Animation Rigging package. Our initial
      goal was to provide a suite of constraints that can be used to create different
      rigs to alter or modify your animation at runtime.   We''ve been exploring many
      of the possibilities that this package offers, pushing the boundaries between
      runtime and authoring. This article sheds light on some of our recent Animation
      Rigging experiments. PLEASE be aware that the state machine in the following
      example is experimental, not necessarily representative of a viable production
      example. We are simply exploring how a technical animator might author constraint
      interactions with a state machine without needing to write any code.  We hope
      this article will inspire you to explore and discover new ways to address the
      animation challenges you face every day. To build a viable and complete animation
      solution, we believe it''s in our best interest to find out what you discovered
      and what you need. '
